# Cinny Desktop (Electron Version)

This is a completely unofficial wrapper around [Cinny](https://github.com/cinnyapp/cinny) made in Electron,
because Tauri works poorly for me, especially on NixOS.

I don't know what I'm doing, beware.

# Additional Features

- Tray icon shows whether there are notifications or not
- QuickCSS support, look in $HOME/.config/cinny-electron/quickcss.css
